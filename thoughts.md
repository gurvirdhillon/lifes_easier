# Page information

So i have made the initial UI for the app in canva. I believe that once the user has registered to the page they should recieve default settings and minimal questions should be asked. If they wish to make changes this shall be done through talking to the "bot" feature.

Still yet to decide on all the features needed in each user category. Once decidied a table will be made to see which features are cross compatible etc.

Need to think about the type of information that should be asked and make sure it is needed for the app.
